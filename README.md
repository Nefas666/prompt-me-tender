## Overview

**Prompt Me Tender** is a web application designed to assist users in retrieving suggestion about a trip or an holiday to schedule. It only needs few details in order to accomplish its purpose. The application leverages a user-friendly interface and a robust backend to provide tailored prompts based on user input. It uses **Gemini AI** for prompting, **Next.js** as framework, **Vercel** for deployments plus **React**, **Tailwindcss** and **shadcn** for styling. 

## Demo

You can test the application by clicking [here](https://prompt-me-tender.vercel.app/).

## Testing

### Included Default Testing

We’ve included some tooling that helps us maintain these templates. This template currently uses:

- [Renovate](https://www.mend.io/free-developer-tools/renovate/) - to regularly update our dependencies
- [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) - to run tests against how the template runs in the browser


If your team is not interested in this tooling, you can remove them with ease!

### Removing Renovate

In order to keep our project up-to-date with dependencies we use a tool called [Renovate](https://github.com/marketplace/renovate). If you’re not interested in this tooling, delete the `renovate.json` file and commit that onto your main branch.

### Removing Cypress

For our testing, we use [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) for end-to-end testing. This makes sure that we can validate that our templates are rendering and displaying as we’d expect. By default, we have Cypress not generate deploy links if our tests don’t pass. If you’d like to keep Cypress and still generate the deploy links, go into your `netlify.toml` and delete the plugin configuration lines:

```diff
[[plugins]]
  package = "netlify-plugin-cypress"
-  [plugins.inputs.postBuild]
-    enable = true
-
-  [plugins.inputs]
-    enable = false
```

## Contributing

2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature/YourFeature`).
3. Make your changes and commit them (`git commit -m 'Add some feature'`).
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/YourFeature`).
5. Open a pull request.
